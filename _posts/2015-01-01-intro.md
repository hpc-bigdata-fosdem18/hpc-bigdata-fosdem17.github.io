### Overview

Welcome to the 3rd edition of the HPC, Big Data and Data Science devroom,
co-located with [FOSDEM 2018](https://fosdem.org/2018/). FOSDEM is an annual
conference about free and open source software, attended by over 5000
developers and open-source enthusiasts from all over the world. This devroom
is organised by representatives from the HPC and Big Data communities,
who are joining forces to bring both communities together.

- High Performance Computing (HPC) and Big Data are two important approaches to scientific computing.
  HPC typically deals with smaller, highly structured data sets and huge amounts of computation while
  Big Data, not surprisingly, deals with gigantic, unstructured data sets and focuses on the I/O
  bottlenecks. With the Big Data trend unlocking access to an unprecedented amount of data, Data
  Science has emerged to tackle the problem of creating processes and approaches to extracting
  knowledge or insights from these data sets. Machine learning and predictive analytics algorithms
  have joined the family of more traditional HPC algorithms and are pushing the requirements of
  cluster and data scalability.

- Free and Open Source communities have been the foundation of the HPC and Big Data communities
  for some time. In the HPC community, it should be no surprise that
  [498 of the Top500 supercomputers in the world run Linux](http://www.top500.org/statistics/details/osfam/1).
  On the Big Data side, the Hadoop ecosystem has had a tremendous amount of Open Source contributions
  from a wide range of organizations coming together under the Apache Software Foundation.

- Our goal is to bring the communities together, share expertise, learn how we can benefit from each
  other's work and foster further joint research and collaboration. We welcome talks about Free and Open Source
  solutions to the challenges presented by large scale computing, data management and data analysis.

The devroom will take place on Sunday, February 4th, 2018, at
[ULB (Campus Solbosch)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1632534522), in Brussels, Belgium. Join us to
enjoy a full day of talks, demos and interesting discussions on open-source HPC, Big Data and Data Science.
